## Agile Adoption Patterns

- [Doing Agile vs. Being Agile](http://agilitrix.com/2016/04/doing-agile-vs-being-agile/) - by Michael Sahota. "Doing Agile is about the practices: standups, user stories, iterations, etc... Being Agile is about our Consciousness or way of being."

- [Optimizing for Iteration Speed](https://erikbern.com/2017/07/06/optimizing-for-iteration-speed.html) - by Erik Bernhardsson. "I’ve written before about the importance of iterating quickly but I didn’t necessarily talk about some concrete things you can do. When I’ve built up the tech team at Better, I’ve intentionally optimized for fast iteration speed above almost everything else. What are some ways we did that?"

- [“WHY Agile?” Workshop](http://agilitrix.com/2014/06/agile-is-not-the-goal-workshop/) - by Michael Sahota. "Here is how to run a one hour workshop turn your “Agile” initiative into something valuable, sustainable and open the door for real change (transformation)."

- [Why Isn’t Agile Working?](https://hackernoon.com/why-isnt-agile-working-d7127af1c552) - by John Cutler. "Agile is worthless unless it serves as a catalyst for continuous improvement."

### Books

- [Patterns of Agile Practice Adoption: The Technical Cluster](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/agile-patterns) - by Amr Elssamadisy. "As more and more people move towards adoption of Agile practices, they are looking for guidance and advice on how to adopt Agile successfully. Unfortunately many of the questions they have such as: “Where do I start?”, “What specific practices should I adopt?”, “How can I adopt incrementally?” and “Where can I expect pitfalls?” are not adequately addressed.  This book answers these questions by guiding the reader in crafting their own adoption strategy focused on their business values and environment.  This strategy is then directly tied to patterns of agile practice adoption that describe how many teams have successfully (and unsuccessfully) adopted practices like test-first development, simple design, and others.
