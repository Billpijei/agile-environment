- [10 Powerful Strategies for Breaking down User Stories in Scrum (with Cheatsheet)](https://medium.com/@chrisverwijs/10-powerful-strategies-for-breaking-down-user-stories-in-scrum-with-cheatsheet-2cd9aae7d0eb) - by Christiaan Verwijs. "In Scrum, a vertical break-down is more useful, in which user stories are broken down into smaller user stories (instead of technical tasks). If user stories are broken down vertically, they are broken down in such a way that smaller items still result in working, demonstrable, software. Functionality will not be split across technical layers or tasks, but across functional layers. So, if the user story is ‘As customer I can pay for my order, so I can get my products’, it can be broken down into smaller user stories like ‘As customer I can pay by wire transfer, so I can get my products’ or ‘As customer I can pay with credit card, so I can get my products’."

- [Splitting user stories -- the hamburger method](https://gojko.net/2012/01/23/splitting-user-stories-the-hamburger-method/) - by Gojko Adzic. "This method works very nicely because it is visual, and it gets people thinking about alternatives while still staying in their comfort zone. It also works nicely with ‘bite-size chunks’ analogies. And you can easily explain why releasing just a technical task doesn’t make sense because no sane person would eat only the lettuce."
