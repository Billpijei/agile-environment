## Scrum

- [Reasons Why Scrum Can Fail](http://www.scrumexpert.com/knowledge/reasons-why-scrum-can-fail/) - by John Yorke. "In essence, I am saying that Scrum fails when those in the named roles fail to live up to the role. This can also include cases where a role isn’t named or when someone or more than one person steps-up into that role. But in either case, if those mindsets are not present on the team it is a recipe for failure."
