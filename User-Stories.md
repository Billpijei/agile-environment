## User Stories

- [“As a user” needs to stop.](https://blog.prototypr.io/stop-it-with-as-a-user-5feb9b38d920) - by Janet Taylor. "When user stories really shine, they tell a story about the person using your product. The person becomes the hero. You’re just there to create the conditions for her to achieve her real-life goals."

- [Designing features using Job Stories](https://blog.intercom.com/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/) - by Alan Klement. "Abstracted attributes and coupling implementation with motivations and outcomes are distractions for a team. If the team digs deep and learns about a customer’s Job To Be Done, they can then more effectively craft solutions. Using Job Stories to design features, UI, and UX is one way to do it."

- [Stories and Epics](https://hackernoon.com/stories-vs-epics-d773118420d2) - by John Cutler. "Less experienced teams tend to get tripped up trying to define Epics, User Stories, Task, and Sub Tasks. The reality is that software product development is typically one big nested hierarchy, and a super messy one at that. Additional tools — like maps, canvasses, designs, wireframes, logic diagrams — are needed to hold the mental model together."
