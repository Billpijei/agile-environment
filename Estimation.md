## Estimation

- [Accuratizing Software Estimation](https://medium.com/pointer-io/accuratizing-software-estimation-cf81a9e9fd87) - by Chet Haase. "The initial answer given by the engineer was reasonable, given their knowledge of the problem domain at the time. It’s just that engineers are always optimistic, accounting only for how long something might take in the best situation, with the best minds, where nothing goes wrong and management leaves them the hell alone. But this never happens in reality, so we need to apply our knowledge of typical software product schedules to derive a more accurate answer."

- [Building a Fort: Lessons in Software Estimation](http://www.construx.com/10x_Software_Development/Building_a_Fort__Lessons_in_Software_Estimation/) - by Steve McConnell. "Whenever I do a physical construction project like this I try to pay attention to which attributes of the project are similar to software projects and which are different. The comparisons are made more challenging by the fact that my construction projects are recreational, whereas I'm trying to draw comparisons to commercial software projects. For the first half of the project, no good similarities jumped at out me. But as the project started to take much longer than I expected, I began to see more and more similarities between my estimates on the fort and problems people run into with software estimates."

- [Can You Stop Using Story Points?](https://hackernoon.com/can-you-stop-using-story-points-ac36449ffa10) - by John Cutler. "In my experience — especially if you stress story splitting practices — you can safely use user story counts instead of story points (to do a variety of jobs)."

- [How to become better at software estimations](https://medium.com/code-runners-blog/how-to-become-better-at-software-estimations-part-2-fb286a9d496a) -  by Rumen Manev. "We also introduced a list of phrases that strongly convey something is definitely not done. - “It works, but…” - “It’s done, but I just have a couple of things to finalise.” - “It’s ready, but I haven’t tested it.” - “It’s done, but I need a few more hours to check for edge cases.” - “It’s OK, but there are a lot of conflicts, so I’d probably need a day to merge.” - “It was working before.” - “It works on my machine.” - “It’s ready. (three days later) OK, now it’s ready”"

- [Magic Estimation](http://www.barryovereem.com/magic-estimation/) - by Barry Overeem. "What is ‘Magic Estimation’ about? It’s an exercise for the Scrum team to estimate an entire product backlog with story points in a reasonable short amount of time. It’s a useful format to get some insights of the size of a backlog. Is it one month, 3 months or 6 months of work we’re talking about?"

- [Pointing Poker](https://www.pointingpoker.com/) (Web app) - "Online, virtual and co-located agile teams use this application during their planning/pointing sessions to effectively communicate points for stories."

- [SE-Radio Episode 273: Steve McConnell on Software Estimation](http://www.se-radio.net/2016/11/se-radio-episode-273-steve-mcconnell-on-software-estimation/) (Podcast) - by SE-Radio. "Sven Johann talks with Steve McConnell about Software Estimation. Topics include when and why businesses need estimates and when they don’t need them; turning estimates into a plan and validating progress on the plan; why software estimates are always full of uncertainties, what these uncertainties are and how to deal with them. They continue with: estimation, planning and monitoring a Scrum project from the beginning to a possible end. They close with estimation techniques in the large (counting, empirical data) and in the small (e.g. poker planning)."

- [Stop Using Story Points](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/stop-using-story-points/) - by  Joshua Kerievsky. "In 2007, a series of experiments led my colleagues and me to increase our agility by dropping story points and velocity calculations. Those same experiments led us to replace fixed-length sprints with a flow-based workflow, and move from standup meetings to frequent team huddles. Our process today looks nothing like a by-the-book, mainstream Agile method largely because we actively look for process waste and experiment to discover better ways of working. In this blog, I'll explain why we dropped story points and velocity calculations and what you can do to work successfully without them."

- [The #NoEstimates Debate: An Unbiased Look at the Origins, Arguments, and Thought Leaders Behind the Movement](https://techbeacon.com/noestimates-debate-unbiased-look-origins-arguments-thought-leaders-behind-movement) - by Malcolm Isaacs. "As I explored what a #NoEstimates project looks like in practice, I examined the opposing perspective. My interview with Peter Kretzman, a strong critic of the #NoEstimates movement and a supporter of the continued use of estimates when effective, demonstrated just how complicated and subtle this debate has really become. For example, there are many points on which Zuill and Kretzman actually agree, giving both sides of the debate common ground on which to build a continually better approach to the question that's being begged: to estimate or not to estimate?"

- [The Practical Realities of Software Estimation](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/software-guesstimation/) - by Scott Ambler. "To summarize, when you are required to provide estimates for your software development efforts that you should take a pragmatic, light-weight approach to doing so.  This blog posting has provided many practical insights that should help guide your decisions.  These insights and many more, are built right into the Disciplined Agile framework."

- [Why Estimation in Software Development is Usually Terrible](https://m.coderdan.co/why-estimation-in-software-development-is-usually-terrible-2d032161bc6) - by Dan Draper. "The problem here is uncertainty. The less certain we are about how exactly to do something the poorer are our estimates of how long that thing will take to achieve."
